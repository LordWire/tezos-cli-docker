# tezos-cli-docker



tezos-cli-docker is a set of scripts to build the tezos-cli tools and containerize them, as well as some convenience scripts to invoke the different binaries. Currently it is a work in progress, so __expect things to break__!

## Features

  - tezos-node convenience script, generates identity before starting the node, if it doesn't already exist.
  - tezos-client convenience script, simply runs tezos-client (lol).
